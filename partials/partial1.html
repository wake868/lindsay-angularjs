            <h2>Thank you.....</h2>
            <p>
                I want to thank everybody who has continued to support me through this! Everybody's words of encouragement have meant so much to me! I have enjoyed all the flowers, balloons and get well cards that I have received! Knowing that I have so much support has been such great motivation for me to get moving and to get home! I would like to tell my parents thank you for taking my son in through all this and I want to thank my cousins Mike and Monica Wakeland for putting this website together for me...I love you guys so much!! I also want to thank the Scappoose fire department and all the paramedics that came to my rescue in the woods!! I would especially like to thank the medical staff at Emanual hospital for taking such good care of me and my injuries! You have all been so great! Last but definitely not least I want to thank my boyfriend, Raymond Ozias, for saving my life! Raymond, you are the love of my life and there are not enough words in this world to express my gratitude! If it wasn't for your quick thinking I would not be here writing this today! You have not left my side since I came to the hospital and for that I cannot thank you enough! You truly are my soulmate and such a caring and amazing person!! Once again I would like to thank everyone for your continued love and support...I could not get through this without you guys!!! Thank you all so much!! ðŸ’—
